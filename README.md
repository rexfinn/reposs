reposs - repo size shields
=============
Clean and simple repository size badge, [courtesy of shields.io](https://github.com/badges/shields), that displays the size of your repository in KB, MB or TB.

##Use
In your README.md, just add an image with the base URL (`https://reposs.herokuapp.com/`) with the path to your **public** repository, for example [CocoaPods/Specs](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs):

```
![](https://reposs.herokuapp.com/?path=CocoaPods/Specs)
```

You will then get a nice and pretty SVG with the size of the repository:

![](https://reposs.herokuapp.com/?path=CocoaPods/Specs)

That's it!

###Further Customization

If you want to change the color of your badge, just append `&color=COLOR_NAME` to the image URL.  By default, the badge is blue.

Available colors are (repo is rexfinn/shields-sizer):
